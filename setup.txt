## SETUP ##
1) In your unity editor, drag and drop the "TerrainLex.unitypackage"

3) In the terrain component of the terrain object, click on the 2nd node "Paint Terrain"

    layer 1 - your grass texture
    layer 2 - your rock texture
    layer 3 - your snow texture
    layer 4 - any texture (placeholder for now)

4) Open "Heightmap to Terrain" tool in the "Tools" bar in the top command bar
5) Select your terrain for "terrain" and drag and drop "heightmap.png" into "Heightmap"
6) Make sure your heightmap and splatmap pngs are "read/write" checked in the inspector
7) Drag and drop "splat.png" into splatmapApplier's "splat" slot, and the terrain into the "terrain" slot
8) Run! It will apply the splatmap on void start()
